Abstract—Need for a priori knowledge of the components comprising
each pixel in a scene has set the endmember determination,
rather than the endmember abundance quantification, as the
primary focus of many unmixing approaches. In the absence of
the information about the pure signatures present in an image
scene, which is often the case, the mean spectra of the pixel
vectors, directly extracted from the scene, are usually used as the
pure signatures’ spectra. This approach which is mathematically
optimized for unmixing problems with a priori known information
ignores some statistical properties of the extracted samples and
leads to a suboptimal solution for real situations. This paper proposes
a novel learning-based unmixing-to-classification conversion
model to treat the abundance quantification task as a classification
problem. Support vector machine, as an efficient classifier, is used
to realize this model. It exploits the statistical nature (endmember
spectral variability) of the extracted endmember representatives
from the hyperspectral scene, rather than solving the problem
according to the ideal model in which only the mean spectra of
each training sample set is used. Several experiments are carried
out on simulated and real hyperspectral images. The obtained
results validate the high performance of the proposed technique
in abundance quantification which is a key subpixel information
detection capability.
